## 📖 Overview

vaultix is a secure, lightweight CLI tool that encrypts files in place using military-grade cryptography. No cloud, no services, no complexity—just strong encryption for your sensitive files.

### Key Highlights

- 🔒 **Strong Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with Argon2id key derivation
- 🚀 **Zero Dependencies**: Single static binary, no runtime requirements
- 💻 **Cross-Platform**: Linux, macOS, and Windows support
- 🎯 **Simple UX**: Intuitive commands with smart defaults
- 🔐 **No Password Storage**: Passwords exist only in memory
- 📦 **Portable**: Encrypted vaults work across all platforms

## ✨ Features

✅ **Automatic Encryption** - Initialize a vault and all files are encrypted instantly  
✅ **Fuzzy File Matching** - No need to type exact filenames  
✅ **Default to Current Directory** - Less typing, more doing  
✅ **Extract or Drop** - Extract files while keeping in vault, or drop them out  
✅ **Secure Deletion** - Original files are overwritten before deletion  
✅ **Hidden Metadata** - Even filenames are encrypted  
✅ **No Background Process** - Runs only when you invoke it

## Security Model

### Cryptography

vaultix uses industry-standard cryptographic primitives:

- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id with 64MB memory, 1 iteration, 4 threads
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Randomness**: Go's `crypto/rand` package

### Threat Model

vaultix protects against:

- Unauthorized access to files at rest (assuming strong password)
- Accidental exposure of file contents
- Casual inspection of encrypted data

vaultix does **not** protect against:

- Weak passwords (use a strong, unique password)
- Malware or keyloggers on your system
- Physical access to your computer while unlocked
- Attacks on the underlying operating system
- Side-channel attacks or memory analysis
- Coercion or legal compulsion

### Important Limitations

- **Password-only security**: Your vault is only as secure as your password
- **No password recovery**: Forget your password = lose your data permanently
- **No automatic backups**: You are responsible for backing up your vaults
- **Single-user design**: No multi-user or sharing capabilities
- **Files only**: Cannot encrypt directories (add files individually)

### Build from Source

Requires Go 1.21 or higher:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zayan-Mohamed/vaultix.git
cd vaultix
go build -o vaultix
```

Then move the binary to your PATH:

**Linux/macOS:**

sudo mv vaultix /usr/local/bin/ # Linux/macOS

```

---

## cd ~/my_secrets

# Initialize vault (encrypts all files automatically)
vaultix init
# Enter password: ****
# Confirm password: ****
# ✓ Vault initialized
# ✓ All files encrypted
# ✓ Original files securely deleted

# List encrypted files
vaultix list
# Files in vault (3):
#   passwords.txt
#   api_keys.json
#   private_key.pem

# Extract a file (keeps in vault)
vaultix extract passwords
# ✓ File extracted: passwords.txt

# Drop a file (extracts and removes from vault)
vaultix drop api_keys
# ✓ Dropped: api_keys.json (extracted and removed from vault)

# Extract all files
vaultix extract
# ✓ Extracted 3 file(s)
```

## 📚 Usage

### Commands

| Command          | Description                            | Example                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `init [path]`    | Initialize vault and encrypt all files | `vaultix init`           |
| `add <file>`     | Add file to vault                      | `vaultix add secret.txt` |
| `list`           | List encrypted files                   | `vaultix list`           |
| `extract [file]` | Extract file(s), keeps in vault        | `vaultix extract`        |
| `drop [file]`    | Extract and remove from vault          | `vaultix drop secret`    |

| `🏗️ Architecture

### Pro [path]`   | List encrypted files                   |`vaultix list` |

| `extract [file]` | Extract file(s), keeps in vault | `vaultix extract` |
| `drop <file>` | Extract and remove from vault | `vaultix drop secret` |
| `remove <file>` | Remove file from vault (no extract) | `vaultix remove old.txt` |
| `clear [path]` | Remove all files from vault | `vaultix clear` |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Most commands default to current directory, so you rarely need to specify paths!

### How It Wfile>`| Remove file without extracting |`vaultix remove old.txt` |

| `clear` | Remove all files (with confirmation) | `vaultix clear` |

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Fuzzy file matching (case-insensitive)
vaultix extract SECRET    # Matches "secret_document.pdf"
vaultix extract api       # Matches "api_keys.json"

# Extract all to specific directory
vaultix extract . /tmp/decrypted/

# Work with specific vault path
vaultix list ~/other_vault
vaultix extract document ~/other_vault
````

For complete usage examples, see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)

```bash
vaultix remove ./my_secrets document.pdf
```

This permanently deletes the encrypted file from the vault.

## How it works

When you initialize a vault at a path (e.g., `./my_secrets`), vaultix creates a hidden `.vaultix/` directory inside:

```
my_secrets/
└── .vaultix/
    ├── meta          # Encrypted metadata (filenames, sizes, timestamps)
    ├── salt          # Random salt for key derivation
    └── objects/
        ├── 3f9a2c1d.enc
        └── 91bd77aa.enc
```

### Security Details

1. **No passwords stored**: Your password exists only in memory during operations
2. **Encrypted metadata**: Even filenames are encrypted
3. **Obfuscated object names**: Encrypted files have random IDs
4. **Salt per vault**: Each vault has a unique random salt
5. **Authentication**: AES-GCM provides both encryption and integrity verification

### Password Verification

Password correctness is verified by successful decryption of the metadata. There are no stored password hashes. This means:

- Incorrect password = decryption failure
- No way to test passwords without attempting decryption
- No way to recover from a forgotten password

## Best Practices

### Password Selection

Use a strong, unique password:

- At least 16 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Not used anywhere else
- Not easily guessable

Consider using a password manager to generate and store your vault password.

### Backup Strategy

- The entire vault directory (including `.vaultix/`) must be backed up
- Test your backups by extracting files from backup copies
- Encrypted vaults are safe to backup to cloud storage
- Losing `.vaultix/` = permanent data loss

### File Management

- Original files are **not** automatically deleted when added to vault
- Delete originals manually if needed (consider secure deletion tools)
- Keep temporary extractions out of the vault directory
- Don't extract sensitive files to public/shared directories

### Operational Security

- Don't enter passwords where they might be logged
- Don't use vaultix over remote connections without encryption
- Close your terminal after vault operations
- Consider using full-disk encryption alongside vaultix
- Be aware of swap files and hibernation dumps
